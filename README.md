# UT Professor Alignment Chart

Like Rate My Professors, but better. **still a work in progress

## Vision

This is a project I thought about starting a few years ago. It's along the same idea as the Rate my Professors site, but instead of actual helpful categories, like level of difficulty or if attendance is required, the only two criteria are "Wholesomeness" -  the measure of how pure, selfless, considerate, etc. a professor is - and "Memeability" - how well the professor can be made into a meme or inside joke.

## What's here

There are two files in here right now: a .txt file I found on my computer from when I started looking up how to make charts, and a .html file that has the properly formated code.

It seems I got the chart code from canvasjs.com.
